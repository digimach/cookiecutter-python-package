Features
========
The following features apply to the template project of this Cookiecutter:

* Tox testing: Test against multiple Python versions (3.6+)
* Development: Easily setup a development environment using Tox
* Makefile: Predefined make rules to build, test, lint and deploy
* Black_ Formatting: Have your Python code formatted in a consistent manner

Quickstart
==========

This is a short summary of all the components this project provides along with
basic examples.

Usage
-----

1. Install :code:`cookiecutter` in your Python environment. Ex:
   :code:`pip install cookiecutter`

2. Use this template project to generate your project
   :code:`cookiecutter https://github.com/Digimach/cookiecutter-pypackage.git`

3. The `Template Variables`_ section defines the Cookiecutter variables that
   will be prompted and used to configure the generated project.

4. If you want to work in a Git repository for the generated project see
   `Git Repository`_.

Template Variables
------------------

* :code:`project_title`: The title of the project that is being created.

* :code:`project_slug`: The slug is used to give the Python package an
  install name. This should be compliant with `PEP-0008: Package and Module
  Names <https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/#package-and-module-names>`_

* :code:`project_short_description`: Project description that will be added
  to `setup.py`_ and published
  with the package.

* :code:`project_author_email`: The author email address that will be used
  for license generation and also published with the package in
  `setup.py`_

* :code:`project_author_name`: The author name that will be used for
  license generation and also published with the package in
  `setup.py`_

* :code:`project_source_url`: HTTP accessible URL that can link to the
  source of the generated project.

* :code:`project_doc_url`: HTTP accessible URL that can link to the
  documentation of the generated project.

* :code:`install_requires`: List of Python packages, in CSV form, that are
  required by the generated project at install.

* :code:`project_extra_dev_requires`: List of Python packages, in CSV form,
  that are required by the generated project during development.

* :code:`project_extra_test_requires`: List of Python packages, in CSV form,
  that are required to test the generated project.

* :code:`project_extra_lint_requires`: List of Python packages, in CSV form,
  that are required to lint the generated project.

* :code:`project_python_max_version`: The maximum version of Python the
  project will be supported on.

* :code:`project_python_min_version`: The minimum version of Python the
  project will be supported on. Has to be lesser or equal than
  :code:`project_python_max_version`.

* :code:`project_valid_python_versions`: List of Python versions, in CSV
  form, that are valid. This can be used to define the versions in between
  :code:`project_python_min_version` and :code:`project_python_max_version`,
  inclusive, that this project will be supported on.

* :code:`initialize_git_repo`: If true, will setup a Git repository in the
  generated project and do an initial commit. You can amend the initial
  commit or add on top. See `Git Repository`_ for more information.

Git Repository
--------------

If :code:`initialize_git_repo` is :code:`yes` (the default) a Git repository
will be initialized in the target repository. This will also do a commit for
you which you can then amend or add on top. This allows you to diff against
the templated project with your own work.

You just have to add the remote to push the Git repository:

.. code-block::

    git remote add origin <repo url>

If you chose :code:`initialize_git_repo` to be :code:`no` you can initialize
the Git repository in your templated project later by doing:

.. code-block::

    git init
    git add --all
    git remote add origin <repo url>
    git push
